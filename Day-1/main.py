I am signing up for Repli's 100 days of Python Challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time everyday coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happened to be.
No excuses for not coding from the middle of field
I am feeling ðŸ«¡
